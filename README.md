# ReactiveAnimation Mac demo

OS X demo for
[ReactiveAnimation](https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveAnimation).

### Getting Started

This demo uses [Carthage](https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage) to manage its
dependencies.

You can install Carthage from [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):

```sh
brew update
brew install carthage
```

Then, in the demoâ€™s folder, run:

```sh
carthage bootstrap
```

After that, you can open up the project file and build.
